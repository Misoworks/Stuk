# Publish the seven public stuk crates to crates.io in dependency order.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/publish.sh                # publish all publishable crates
#   scripts/publish.sh --dry-run      # dry-run only, nothing uploaded
#   scripts/publish.sh --allow-dirty  # also pass through to cargo
#   scripts/publish.sh --package-only # like --dry-run, but skip the verify step
#                                     # (needed when upstream crates that we depend on
#                                     # haven't been published to crates.io yet)
#
# Required: a valid crates.io token (`cargo login <TOKEN>`).
